# Project Handover Documentation

## Overview
This project is a Neovim configuration designed to enable an efficient and streamlined development workflow. It incorporates modern plugins and utility tools using lazy.nvim for plugin management. The configuration is primarily written in Lua.

### Key Features
- **Plugin Management:** Utilizes lazy.nvim for modular plugin loading and management.
- **Configuration File:** The primary configuration entry point is `init.lua`.

## Directory Structure
- `.`
  - Contains primary configuration files such as `init.lua` and JSON files for various settings.
- `lazy-lock.json` and `lazyvim.json`: These files define the locked versions of plugins and specific LazyVim-related configurations.
- `stylua.toml`: Configuration for formatting Lua files using `stylua`.
- `.neoconf.json`: General configurations for Neovim.

## Main Files
- **`init.lua`:**
  - Initializes the Neovim setup and loads `config.lazy`.
  - Contains a placeholder for possible test setups with adapters (e.g., `neotest`).

## Dependencies
- **Neovim:** Ensure you have Neovim 0.8+ installed to use this configuration.
- **lazy.nvim:** Included in the configuration bootstrap, it dynamically loads plugins to optimize startup performance.
- **stylua:** Required for Lua code formatting. Configurations are available in `stylua.toml`.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone this project into your Neovim configuration directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository> ~/.config/nvim
   ```
2. Launch Neovim. lazy.nvim will automatically install and setup plugins.
3. Modify `init.lua` as needed to tailor the configuration to your preferences.

## Additional Notes
- **Testing Setup:** The `init.lua` file contains commented code for integrating `neotest` and a `.NET` adapter. Developers can uncomment and extend this as needed.
- **License:** Refer to the LICENSE file for information regarding usage and distribution.

This document should serve as a concise guide for understanding and extending the current Neovim configuration setup.
